This blog is about anything about software development that is important to me.
It explores technical problems, personal development, and design principles. It
generally follows my professional journey. I tend to spend a lot of time
thinking about software, and these are a few of my thoughts.

I'm an software architect at [ParentSquare][work]. I'm married to a beautiful
wife, and have two wonderful kids. After graduating from university, I've worked
at various SaaS companies, and dedicated a large portion of my life to creating
quality software for those products.
